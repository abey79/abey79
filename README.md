### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antoine Beyeler and I write tools to help making generative art with drawing robots. My main projects are:
- [*vpype*](https://github.com/abey79/vpype): the Swiss-Army-knife command-line tool for plotter vector graphics
- [*vsketch*](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch): Python plotter generative art framework and workflow automation

More plotter-related projects are hosted under the [Plotter Tools](https://github.com/plottertools) organisation.

I sometimes post project notes and other articles on my homepage at [bylr.info](https://bylr.info).
