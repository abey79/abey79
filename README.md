### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I write tools to help making generative art with drawing robots. My main projects are:
- [*vpype*](https://github.com/abey79/vpype): the Swiss-Army-knife command-line tool for plotter vector graphics
- [*vsketch*](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch): Python plotter generative art framework and workflow automation
